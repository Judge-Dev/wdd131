            <h2>Genesis 6:4</h2>
            <p>There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the
                daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of
                renown.

            <p>And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten
                us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto
                us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
